      <description>Proper Scoring Rules Commonly Used Proper Scoring Rules Structure of Proper Scoring Rules Proper scoring rules are mixtures of cost-weighted misclassification losses Beta Family of Proper Scoring Rules Examples   For the pdf slides, click here
Notations: in binary classification  We are interested in fitting a model \(q(\mathbf{x})\) for the true conditional class 1 probability \[ \eta(\mathbf{x}) = P(Y = 1 \mid \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}) \]</description>

      <description>Generalized \(R^2\) by Cox and Snell Generalized \(R^2\) by Nagelkerke Generalized \(R^2\) for binary data    For the pdf slides, click here
\(R^2\) for normal linear regression  \(R^2\), also called coefficient of determination or multiple correlation coefficient, is defined for normal linear regression, as the proportion of variance “explained” by the regression model \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:R2} R^2 = \frac{\sum_i \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2}{\sum_i \left( y_i - \bar{y} \right)^2} \end{equation}\]</description>
