Introduction to Instrumental Variables Unmeasured confounding  Suppose there are unobserved variables \(U\) that affect both \(A\) and \(Y\), then \(U\) is an unmeasured confounding   This violates ignorability assumption</description>

Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting Motivating example  Suppose there is a single confounder \(X\), with propensity scores \[ P(A=1\mid X=1) = 0.1, \quad P(A=1\mid X=0) = 0.8 \]   In propensity score matching, for subjects with \(X=1\), 1 out of 9 controls will be matched to the treated</description>

      <description>Matching Experiments vs observational studies Overview of matching Nearest neighbor matching Optimal matching Assessing matching balance Analyze data after matching  Propensity Score Propensity score matching    For the pdf slides, click here
Matching Experiments vs observational studies Randomized trials  In experiments, treatment \(A\) is determined by a coin toss; so there are no arrows from \(X\) to \(A\), i.e., no backdoor paths
 Covariate balance: distribution of pre-treatment variables \(X\) are the same in both treatment groups</description>

Confounding Confounding  Confounders: variables that affect both the treatment and the outcome
 If we assign treatment based on a coin flip, since the coin flip doesn’t affect the outcome, it’s not a confounder</description>

      <description>Notations and Terminologies Potential outcomes and conterfactuals  What are Causal Effects? Fundamental problem of causal inference  Causal Assumptions Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) Consistency Ignorability Positivity  Standardization and Stratification   For the pdf slides, click here
Notations and Terminologies Notations  We are interested in the causal effect of some treatment \(A\) on some outcome \(Y\)
 Treatment: \(A\), binary
 \(A=1\) if receive treatment; and \(A=0\) if receive control</description>

      <title>My first post about statistics!</title>

      <description>Finally, a post not about cooking &amp;hellip;
I recently gave a 1.5-hours lecture to friends who were interested in Bayesian statistics, and the slides are here.
This lecture covers (very briefly) the following topics
  Bayes formula (i.e., conditional probablity)
 Example: breast cancer screening    Bayesian parameter estimation (i.e., posterior distribution formula)
 Beta-Binomial updating, with a coin flipping example Example: Bayesian inference on the Rotten Tomato &amp;ldquo;freshness&amp;rdquo; of the Harry Potter movie series (This is what the above picture is about) MCMC (very high-level intro)    Bayesian hypothesis testing</description>
