      <description>Empirical Comparisms between Neural Networks (NN) and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) Tabular Deep Learning  Neural Networks (Non Transformer-Based)  Transformer-Based GBDT Inspired Preprocessing References   It has almost been 10 years since modern implementations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), such as XGBoost [REF], LightGBM [REF], and CatBoost [REF], have become the industry standard machine learning methods for predictive modeling (classification and regression), thanks to their superior predictive accuracy and computation efficiency.</description>
