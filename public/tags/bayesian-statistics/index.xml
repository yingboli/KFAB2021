      <description>Finally, a post not about cooking &amp;hellip;
I recently gave a 1.5-hours lecture to friends who were interested in Bayesian statistics, and the slides are here.
This lecture covers (very briefly) the following topics
  Bayes formula (i.e., conditional probablity)
 Example: breast cancer screening    Bayesian parameter estimation (i.e., posterior distribution formula)
 Beta-Binomial updating, with a coin flipping example Example: Bayesian inference on the Rotten Tomato &amp;ldquo;freshness&amp;rdquo; of the Harry Potter movie series (This is what the above picture is about) MCMC (very high-level intro)    Bayesian hypothesis testing</description>
