 State-based models: search problems, MDPs, games  Applications: route finding, game playing, etc Terms: states, actions, costs  Variable-based models: CSPs, Bayesian networks  Applications: scheduling, tracking, medical diagnosis, etc Terms: variables, factors  Logic-based models: propositional logic, first-order logic  Applications: theorem proving, verification, etc Terms: logical formulas, inference rules Problems with logic:  Deterministic, cannot handle uncertainty Rule-based, does not allow to learn from data     Propositional Logic  Propositional symbols (atomic formulas): \(A, B, C\)</description>
