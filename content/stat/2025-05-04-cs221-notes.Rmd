# Week 3. Search

## Overview



## Tree Search

### Defining a search problem


* $s_\text{start}$: stating state. 
* Actions$(s)$: possible actions
* Cost$(s, a)$: action cost
* Succ$(s, a)$: the successor state
* IsEnd$(s)$: reached end state? 


### A search tree

* Node: a state
* Edge: an (action, cost) pair
* Root: starting state
* Leaf nodes: end states

* Each root-to-leaf path represents a possible action sequence, and the sum of the costs of the edges is the cost of that path

* **Objective**: find a minimal cost path to the end state


### Coding a search problem
* A class with the following methods:
    - `stateState() -> State`
    - `isEnd(State) -> bool`
    - `succAndCost(State) -> List[Tuple[str, State, float]]` returns a list of `(action, state, cost)` tuples.
