# Introduction to Instrumental Variables

### Unmeasured confounding

* Suppose there are unobserved variables $U$ that affect both $A$ and $Y$, then $U$ is an `r blue('unmeasured confounding')`

```{r, echo=FALSE, engine='tikz', out.width='20%', fig.ext='png'}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {}] 
\node[main] (1) {$U$}; 
\node[main] (2) [below left of=1] {$A$}; 
\node[main] (3) [below right of=1] {$Y$}; 
\node[main] (4) [below right of=2] {$X$}; 
\draw[->, dashed] (1) -- (2); 
\draw[->, dashed] (1) -- (3); 
\draw[->] (2) -- (3); 
\draw[->] (4) -- (2); 
\draw[->] (4) -- (3); 
\end{tikzpicture} 
```

* `r red('This violates ignorability assumption')`

* Since we cannot control for the unobserved confounders $U$ and average over its distribution, if using matching or IPTW methods, `r red('the estimates of causal effects is biased')`


* `r green('Solution: instrumental variables')`

### Instrumental variables

* `r blue('Instrumental variables (IV)')`: an alternative causal inference method that does not rely on the ignorability assumption

```{r, echo=FALSE, engine='tikz', out.width='25%', fig.ext='png'}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {}] 
\node[main] (1) {$Z$}; 
\node[main] (2) [right of=1] {$A$}; 
\node[main] (3) [below right of=2] {$X$}; 
\node[main] (4) [above right of=3] {$Y$}; 
\draw[->] (1) -- (2); 
\draw[->] (2) -- (4); 
\draw[->] (3) -- (2); 
\draw[->] (3) -- (4); 
\end{tikzpicture} 
```

* $Z$ is an IV

    - It affects treatment $A$, but does not directly affect the outcome $Y$
    - We can think of $Z$ as `r blue('encouragement (of treatement)')`
    
### Example of an encouragement design

* $A$: smoking during pregnancy (yes/no)
* $Y$: birth weight
* $X$: mother's age, weight, etc

    - `r red('Concern: there could be unmeasured confounders')`
    - `r red('Challenge: it is not ethical to randomly assign smoking')`


* $Z$: randomized to either received encouragement to stop smoking ($Z=1$) or receive usual care ($Z=0$)

    - `r blue('Causal effect of encouragement')`, also called `r blue('intent-to-treat (ITT) effect')`, may be of some interest
    \[E\left(Y^{Z=1}\right)-E\left(Y^{Z=0}\right)\] 
    - `r green('Focus of IV methods is still causal effect of the treatment')`
    \[E\left(Y^{A=1}\right)-E\left(Y^{A=0}\right)\] 

### IV is randomized 

* Like the previous smoking example, 
sometimes IV is randomly assigned as part of the study

* Other times IV is **believed** to be randomized in nature (`r blue('natural experiment')`). For example,

    - Mendelian randomization (?)
    - Quarter of birth
    - Geographic distance to specialty care provider

## Randomized trials with noncompliance

### Randomized trials with noncompliance

* Setup
    - $Z$: **randomization** to treatment (1 treatment, 0 control)
    - $A$: treatment received, binary (1 treatment, 0 control)
    - $Y$: outcome

* Due to noncompliance, not everyone assigned treatment will actually receive the treatment, and vice verse ($A \neq Z$)
    - There can be confounding $X$, like common causes affecting both treatment received $A$ and the outcome $Y$
    - It may be reasonable to assume that $Z$ does not directly affect $Y$
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, engine='tikz', out.width='25%', fig.ext='png'}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {}] 
\node[main] (1) {$Z$}; 
\node[main] (2) [right of=1] {$A$}; 
\node[main] (3) [below right of=2] {$X$}; 
\node[main] (4) [above right of=3] {$Y$}; 
\draw[->] (1) -- (2); 
\draw[->] (2) -- (4); 
\draw[->] (3) -- (2); 
\draw[->] (3) -- (4); 
\end{tikzpicture} 
```

### Causal effect of assignment on receipt

* Observed data: $(Z, A, Y)$

* Each subject has two `r blue('potential values of treatment')`

    - $A^{Z=1} = A^1$: value of treatment if randomized to treatment
    - $A^{Z=0} = A^0$: value of treatment if randomized to control
    
* Average causal effect of `r blue('treatment assignment on treatment received')`
\[E\left(A^1 - A^0\right)\]
    - If perfect compliance, this would be $1$
    - By randomization and consistency, this is estimable from the observed data
    \[
    E\left(A^1\right) = E(A \mid Z=1), \quad
    E\left(A^0\right) = E(A \mid Z=0)
    \]

    
### Causal effect of assignment on outcome

* Average causal effect of `r blue('treatment assignment on the outcome')`
\[E\left(Y^{Z=1} - Y^{Z=0}\right)\]

    - This is intention-to-treat effect
    - If perfect compliance, this would be equal to the causal effect of treatment received
    - By randomization and consistency, this is estimable from the observed data
    \[
    E\left(Y^{Z=1}\right) = E(Y \mid Z=1), \quad
    E\left(Y^{Z=0}\right) = E(Y \mid Z=0)
    \]
    
    
## Compliance classes

### Subpopulations based on potential treatment

| $A^0$ | $A^1$ | Label        |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 0     | Never-takers |
| 0     | 1     | Compliers    |
| 1     | 0     | Defiers      |
| 0     | 0     | Always-takers|

* For never-takers and always-takers,
    - Encouragement does not work
    - Due to no variation in treatment received, we cannot learn anything about the effect of treatment in these two subpopulations
    
* For compliers, treatment received is randomized
* For defiers, treatment received is also randomized, but in the opposite way

### Local average treatment effect

* We will focus on a local average treatment effect, i.e., the `r blue('complier average causal effect (CACE)')`

\begin{align*}
& E\left(Y^{Z=1} \mid A^0=0, A^1=1  \right)
- E\left(Y^{Z=0} \mid A^0=0, A^1=1  \right)\\
= & E\left(Y^{Z=1} - Y^{Z=0} \mid \text{compliers} \right)\\
= & E\left(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \mid \text{compliers} \right)
\end{align*}

* "Local": this is a causal effect in a subpopulation
* No inference about defiers, always-takers, or never-takers

## Instrumental variable assumptions

### IV assumption 1: `r blue('exclusion restriction')`

1. $Z$ is associated with the treatment $A$
    
```{r, out.width='24%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/crash_course_causality_week5_fig2.png', error = FALSE)
```

2. $Z$ affects the outcome only through its effect on treatment
    
    ```{r, out.width='37%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/crash_course_causality_week5_fig1.png', error = FALSE)
```

    - $Z$ cannot directly, or indirectly though its effect on $U$, affect $Y$
    
```{r, out.width='29%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/crash_course_causality_week5_fig3.png', error = FALSE)
```

### Is the exclusion restriction assumption realistic?

* If $Z$ is a random treatment assignment, then the exclusion restriction assumption is met

    - It should affect treatment received
    - It should not affect the outcome or unmeasured confounders
    
* However, it the subjects or clinicians are not blinded, knowledge of what they are assigned to could affect $Y$ or $U$

* `r red('We need to examine the exclusion restriction assumption carefully for any given study')`

### IV assumption 2: `r blue('monotonicity')`
    
* `r blue('Monotonicity assumption')`: there are no defiers

    - No one consistently does the opposite of what they are told
    - Probability of treatment should increase with more encouragement
    
* With monotonicity,
    
| $Z$   | $A$   | $A^0$ | $A^1$ | Class              |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 0     | 0     | ?     | Never-takers or compliers|
| 0     | 1     | 1     | `r red('1')` | Always-takers ~~or defiers~~    |
| 1     | 0     | `r red('0')` | 0     | Never-takers ~~or defiers~~    |
| 1     | 1     | ?     | 1     | Always-takers or compliers|


# Estimate Causal Effects with Instrumental Variables

### Estimate CACE: 1. rewrite the ITT effect

* Due to randomization, we can identify the ITT effect
\[
E\left( Y^{z=1} - Y^{z=0} \right) = E(Y\mid Z=1) - E(Y\mid Z=0)
\]

* Expand the first term in the above ITT effect 
\begin{align*}
E(Y\mid Z=1) = &
E(Y\mid Z=1, \text{always takers})P(\text{always takers}\mid Z=1)\\
& + E(Y\mid Z=1, \text{never takers})P(\text{never takers}\mid Z=1)\\
& + E(Y\mid Z=1, \text{compliers})P(\text{compliers}\mid Z=1)
\end{align*}

* Note 1: among always takers and never takes, $Z$ does nothing
    - $E(Y\mid Z=1, \text{always takers}) = E(Y\mid \text{always takers}), \quad \text{etc.}$    

* Note 2: by randomization,
    - $P(\text{always takers}\mid Z=1) = P(\text{always takers}), \quad \text{etc.}$
    
### Estimate CACE: 1. rewrite the ITT effect, cont.

* Therefore, the first term in the ITT effect is
\begin{align*}
E(Y\mid Z=1)=& E(Y\mid\text{always takers})P(\text{always takers})\\
& + E(Y\mid \text{never takers})P(\text{never takers})\\
& + E(Y\mid Z=1, \text{compliers})P(\text{compliers})
\end{align*}

* Similarly, the second term is
\begin{align*}
E(Y\mid Z=0)=& E(Y\mid\text{always takers})P(\text{always takers})\\
& + E(Y\mid \text{never takers})P(\text{never takers})\\
& + E(Y\mid Z=0, \text{compliers})P(\text{compliers})
\end{align*}

* Their difference is
\begin{align*}
& E(Y\mid Z=1) - E(Y\mid Z=0)\\
= & \left[E(Y\mid Z=1, \text{compliers})- E(Y\mid Z=0, \text{compliers})\right]P(\text{compliers})
\end{align*}

### Estimate CACE: 2. compute proportion of compliers

* Thus, the relationship between CACE and ITT effect is
\[
\text{CACE} = \frac{E(Y\mid Z=1) - E(Y\mid Z=0)}{P(\text{compliers})}
\]

* To compute $P(\text{compliers})$, note that

    - $E(A\mid Z=1)$: proportion of always takers plus compliers
    - $E(A\mid Z=0)$: proportion of always takers 

* Thus the difference is
\[
P(\text{compliers}) = E(A\mid Z=1) - E(A\mid Z=0)
\]

### Estimate CACE: final formula

\[
\text{CACE} = \frac{E(Y\mid Z=1) - E(Y\mid Z=0)}
{E(A\mid Z=1) - E(A\mid Z=0)}
\]

* Numerator: ITT, causal effect of treatment assignment on the outcome

* Denominator: causal effect of treatment assignment on the treatment received
    - Denominator is between 0 and 1. Thus, CACE $\geq$ ITT
    - ITT is underestimate of CACE, because some people assigned to treatment did not take it
    
* If perfect compliance, CACE $=$ ITT

## IVs in observational studies

### IVs in observational studies

* IVs can also be used in observational (non-randomized) studies

    - $Z$: instrument
    - $A$: treatment
    - $Y$: outcome
    - $X$: covariates
    
* $Z$ can be thought of as encouragement
     - If binary, just encouragement yes or no
     - If continuous, a 'dose' of encouragement 
     
* $Z$ can be thought of as randomizers in natural experiments

    - `r red('The key challenge: think of a variable that affects $Y$ only through $A$')`
    - Only the assumption $Z$ affecting $A$ can be checked with data
    - The validity of the exclusion restriction assumption rely on subject matter knowledge
    
### Natural experiment example 1: calendar time as IV

* Rationale: sometimes treatment preferences change over a short period of time

* $A$: drug A vs drug B

* $Z$: early time period (drug A is encouraged) vs late time period (drug B is encouraged)

* $Y$: BMI

### Natural experiment example 2: distance as IV

* Rationale: shorter distance to NICU is an encouragement

* $A$: delivery at high level NICU vs regular hospital

* $Z$: differential travel time from nearest high level NICU to nearest regular hospital

* $Y$: mortality

### More examples of natural experiments

* Mendelian randomization: some genetic variant is associate with some behavior (e.g., alcohol use) but is assumed to not be associated with outcome of interest

* Provider preference: use treatment prescribed to previous patients as an IV for current patient

* Quarter of birth: to study causal effect of years in school on income

## Two stage least squares

### Ordinary least squares (OLS) fails if there is confounding

* In OLS, one important assumption is that the covariate $A$ is independent with residuals $\epsilon$

\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + A_i \beta_1 + \epsilon_i
\]

* However, if there is confounding, $A$ and $\epsilon$ are correlated. So OLS fails.

* `r green('Two stage least squares can estimate causal effect in the instrumental variables (IV) setting')`

### `r blue('Two stage least squares (2SLS)')`

* Stage 1: regress $A$ on $Z$
\[
A_i = \alpha_0 + Z_i \alpha_1 + e_i
\]
    - By randomization, $Z$ and $e$ are independent

* Obtain the predicted value of $A$ given $Z$ for each subject
    \[
    \hat{A}_i = \hat{\alpha}_0 + Z_i \hat{\alpha}_1
    \]
    - $\hat{A}$ is projection of $A$ onto the space spanned by $Z$
    
* Stage 2: regress $Y$ on $\hat{A}$
\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \hat{A}_i \beta_1 + \epsilon_i
\]
    - By exclusion restriction, $Z$ is independent of $Y$ given $A$
    
### Interpretation of $\beta_1$ in 2SLS: the causal effect    
    
* Consider the case where both $Z$ and $A$ are binary
\[
\beta_1 = E\left(Y \mid \hat{A}=1 \right) - E\left(Y \mid \hat{A}=0 \right)
\]

* There are two values of $\hat{A}$ in the 2nd stage model, $\hat{\alpha}_0$ and $\hat{\alpha}_0 + \hat{\alpha}_1$

    - When we go from $Z=0$ to $Z=1$, what we observe is going from $\hat{\alpha}_0$ to $\hat{\alpha}_0 + \hat{\alpha}_1$
    - We observe a mean difference of $\hat{E}(Y\mid Z=1) - \hat{E}(Y\mid Z=0)$ with a $\hat{\alpha}_1$ unit change in $\hat{A}$
    
* Thus, we should observe a mean difference of
$\frac{\hat{E}(Y\mid Z=1) - \hat{E}(Y\mid Z=0)}{\hat{\alpha}_1}$
with $1$ unit change in $\hat{A}$

* `r green('The 2SLS estimator is a consistent estimator of the CACE')`
\[
\beta_1 = \text{CACE} = \frac{\hat{E}(Y\mid Z=1) - \hat{E}(Y\mid Z=0)}{\hat{E}(A\mid Z=1) - \hat{E}(A\mid Z=0)}
\]

### More general 2SLS

* 2SLS can be used   

    - with covariates $X$, and 
    - for non-binary data (e.g, a continuous instrument)

* Stage 1: regression $A$ on $Z$ and covariates $X$

    - and obtain the fitted values $\hat{A}$

* Stage 2: regress $Y$ on $\hat{A}$ and $X$

    - Coefficient of $\hat{A}$ is the causal effect

## Sensitivity analysis and weak instruments

### Sensitivity analysis

* `r blue('Sensitivity analysis')` method studies when each of the IV assumption (partly) fails

    - Exclusion restriction: if $Z$ does affect $Y$ by an amount $p$, would my conclusion change? Vary $p$
    - Monotonically: if the proportion of defiers was $\pi$, would my conclusion change?
    
### Strength of IVs

* Depend on how well an IV predicts treatment received, we can class it as a `r blue('strong instrument')` or a `r blue('weak instrument')`

* For a weak instrument, encouragement barely increases the probability of treatment

* Measure the strength of an instrument: estimate the proportion of compliers
\[
E(A \mid Z=1) - E(A \mid Z=0)
\]

    - Alternatively, we can just use the observed proportions of treated subjects for $Z=1$ and for $Z=0$

### Problems of weak instruments

* Suppose only 1% of the population are compliers

* Then only 1% of the samples have useful information about the treatment effect

    - This leads to large variance estimates, i.e., estimate of causal effect is unstable
    - The confidence intervals can be too wide to be useful
