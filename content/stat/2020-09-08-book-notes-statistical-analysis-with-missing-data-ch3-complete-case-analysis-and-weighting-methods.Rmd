### Complete-case (CC) analysis


* `r blue('Complete-case (CC) analysis')`: use only data points (units) where all variables are observed

* Loss of information in CC analysis:
  
    - Loss of precision (larger variance)
    - Bias, when the missingness mechanism is not MCAR. In this case, the complete units are not a random sample of the population
    
* In this notes, I will focus on the bias issue
    
    - Adjusting for the CC analysis bias using weights
    - This idea is closed related to weighting in randomization inference for finite population surveys

# Weighted Complete-Case Analysis

### Notations

* Population size $N$, sample size $n$
* Number of variables (items): $K$
* Data: $Y=(y_{ij})$, where $i = 1, \ldots, N$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K$
* Design information (about sampling or missingness): $Z$
* Sample indicator: $I = (I_1, \ldots, I_N)'$; for unit $i$, 
\[
I_i = \mathbf{1}_{\{\text{unit } i \text{ included in the sample}\}}
\]
    
* Sample selection processes can be characterized by a distribution for $I$ given $Y$ and $Z$. 

### Probability sampling

* Properties of `r blue('probability sampling')`

    1. Unconfounded: selection doesn't depend on $Y$, i.e.,
    \[
    f(I \mid Y, Z) = f(I \mid Z)
    \]
    
    2. Every unit has a positive (known) probability of selection
    \[
    \pi_i = P(I_i = 1 \mid Z) > 0, \quad \text{for all } i
    \]

* In `r blue('equal probability sample design')`, $\pi_i$ is the same for all $i$

### Stratified random sampling

* $Z$ is a variable defining strata. Suppose Stratum $Z=j$ has $N_j$ units in total, 
for $j= 1, \ldots, J$

* In Stratum $j$, `r blue('stratified random sampling')` takes a simple random sample of $n_j$ units

* The distribution of $I$ under stratified random sampling is
\[
f(I \mid Z) = \prod_{j=1}^J {N_j \choose n_j}^{-1}
\]

### `r green('Example: estimating population mean')` $\bar{Y}$

* An unbiased estimate is the stratified sample mean
\[
\bar{y}_{\text{st}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J N_j \bar{y}_j}{N}
\]
where $\bar{y}_j$ is the sample mean in stratum $j$

* Sampling variance approximation
\[
v(\bar{y}_{st}) \approx \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{j=1}^J N_j^2 
  \left(\frac{1}{n_j} - \frac{1}{N_j} \right)s_j^2
\]
where $s_j$ is the sample variance of $Y$ in stratum $j$

* A large sample 95\% confidence interval for $\bar{Y}$ is
\[
\bar{y}_{\text{st}} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{v(\bar{y}_{st})}
\]

### Weighting methods

* `r red('Main idea: A unit selected with probability')` $\pi_i$ `r red('is "representing"')` $\pi_i^{-1}$ `r red('units in the population, hence should be given weights')` $\pi_i^{-1}$.

* For example, in stratified random sample
    
    - A selected unit $i$ in stratum $j$ represents $N_j/n_j$ population units
    - Thus by `r blue('Horvitz-Thompson estimate')`, the population mean can be estimated by the weighted sum
    \[
    \bar{y}_w = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n w_i y_i, \quad 
    \pi_i = \frac{n_j}{N_j}, \quad w_i = n \cdot \frac{\pi_i^{-1}}{\sum_k \pi_k^{-1}}
    \]
    - It is not hard to show that 
    \[
    \bar{y}_w = \bar{y}_{\text{st}}
    \]
    
### Weighting with nonresponses

* If the probability of selecting unit $i$ is $\pi_i$, and the probability of response for unit $i$ is $\phi_i$, then
\[
P(\text{unit } i \text{ is observed}) = \pi_i \phi_i
\]

* Suppose there are $r$ units observed (respondents). Then the weighted estimate for $\bar{Y}$ is
\[
\bar{y}_w = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{i=1}^r w_i y_i, \quad
w_i = r \cdot \frac{(\pi_i \phi_i)^{-1}}{\sum_k (\pi_k \phi_k)^{-1}}
\]

* Usually $\phi_i$ is unknown and thus needs to be estimated

### `r blue('Weighting class estimator')`

* Weighting class adjustments are used primarily to handle unit nonresponse

* Suppose we partition the sample into $J$ "weighting classes". 
In the weighting class $C = j$:  

    - $n_j$: the sample size 
    - $r_j$: number of observed samples 
    - A simple estimator for $\phi_j$ is $\hat{\phi}_j = \frac{r_j}{n_j}$

* For equal probability designs, where $\pi_i$ is constant, 
the weighting class estimator is
\[
\bar{y}_{\text{wc}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^J n_j \bar{y}_{j\text{R}}
\]
where $\bar{y}_{j\text{R}}$ is the respondent mean in class $j$

* The estimate is unbiased under the following form of MAR assumption
`r red('(Quasirandomization)')`: data are MCAR within weighting class $j$ 


### More about weighting class adjustments

* `r green('Pros')`: handle bias with one set of weights for multivariate $Y$

* `r red('Cons')`: weighting is inefficient and can increase in sampling variance, 
if $Y$ is weakly related to the weighting class variable $C$

* How to choose weighting class adjustments: weighting is only effective for outcomes ($Y$) that are associated with the adjustment cell variable ($C$). See the right column in the table below.

```{r, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/Little_Rubin_book_tb3_1.png', error = FALSE)
```

### Propensity weighting

* The theory of propensity scores provides a prescription for choosing the coarsest reduction of $X$ to a weighting class variable $C$ so that quasirandomization is roughly satisfied

* Let $X$ denote the variables observed for both respondents and nonrespondents

* Suppose data are MAR, with $\phi$ being unknown parameters about missing mechanism
\[
P(M \mid X, Y, \phi) = P(M \mid X, \phi)
\]
Then quasirandomization is satisfied when $C$ is chosen to be $X$

### Response propensity stratification

* Define `r blue('response propensity')` for unit $i$ as
\[
\rho(x_i, \phi) = P\left(m_i = 0 \mid \rho(x_i, \phi), \phi\right)
\]
i.e., `r green ('respondents are a random subsample within strata defined by the propensity score')` $\rho(X, \phi)$

* Usually $\phi$ is unknown. So **a practical procedure** is

    (i) Estimate $\hat{\phi}$ from a binary regression of $M$ on $X$, 
    based on respondent and nonrespondent data
    (ii) Let $C$ be a grouped variable by coarsening $\rho\left(X, \hat{\phi}\right)$ into 5 or 10 values
    
* Thus, within the same adjustment class, all respondents and nonrespondents have the same value of the grouped propensity score 
    
### An alternative procedure: propensity weighting

* An alternative procedure is to weight respondents $i$ directly by the inverse propensity score $\rho\left(X, \hat{\phi}\right)^{-1}$

* `r green('This method removes nonresponse bias')`

* `r red('But it may yield estimates with extremely high sampling variance because respondents with very low estimated response propensities receive large nonresponse weights')`

* `r red('Also, weighting directly by inverse propensities place may reliance on correct model specification of the regression of $M$ on $X$')`

### `r green('Example: inverse probability weighted generalized estimating equations (GEE)')`

* Let $x_i$ be covariates of GEE, and $z_i$ be a fully observed vector that can predict missing mechanism

* If $P(m_i = 1 \mid x_i, y_i, z_i, \phi) = P(m_i = 1 \mid x_i, \phi)$, then
the unweighted completed case GEE is unbiased
\[
\sum_{i=1}^r D_i(x_i, \beta)\left[y_i - g(x_i, \beta)\right] = 0
\]

* If $P(m_i = 1 \mid x_i, y_i, z_i, \phi) = P(m_i = 1 \mid x_i, z_i, \phi)$, then
the inverse probability weighted GEE is unbiased
\[
\sum_{i=1}^r w_i(\hat{\alpha}) D_i(x_i, \beta)\left[y_i - g(x_i, \beta)\right] = 0, \quad
w_i(\hat{\alpha}) = \frac{1}{p(x_i, z_i \mid \hat{\alpha})}
\]
where $p(x_i, z_i \mid \hat{\alpha})$ is the probability of being a complete unit,
based on logistic regression of $m_i$ on $x_i, z_i$

### Poststratification

* The weighting class estimator 
\[
\bar{y}_{\text{wc}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^J n_j \bar{y}_{j\text{R}}
\]
uses the sample proportion $n_j/n$ to estimate the population proportion $N_j/N$.

* If from an external resource (e.g., census or a large survey), 
we know the population proportion of weighting classes, then we can use the post stratified mean to estimate $\bar{Y}$:
\[
\bar{y}_{\text{ps}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^J N_j \bar{y}_{j\text{R}}
\]

### Summary of weighting methods

* Weighted CC estimates are often simple to compute, 
but the appropriate standard errors can be hard to compute (even asymptotically)

* Weighting methods treat weights as fixed and known, 
but these nonresponse weights are computed from observed data and hence are subject to sampling uncertainty

* Because weighted CC methods discard incomplete units and do not provide an automatic control of sampling variance, they are most useful when

    - Number of covariates is small, and
    - Sample size is large

# Available-Case Analysis

### Available-case (AC) analysis

* `r blue('Available-case analysis')`: for univariate analysis, include all unites where that variable is present

    - Sample changes from variable to variable according to the pattern of missing data
    - This is problematic if not MCAR
    - Under MCAR, AC can be used to estimate mean and variance for a single variable
    
* `r blue('Pairwise AC')`: estimates covariance of $Y_j$ and $Y_k$ based on units $i$ where both $y_{ij}$ and $y_{ik}$ are observed

    - Pairwise covariance estimator:
    \[
    s_{jk}^{(jk)} = \sum_{i \in I_{jk}} 
    \left( y_{ij} - \bar{y}_j^{(jk)} \right)
    \left( y_{ik} - \bar{y}_k^{(jk)} \right)/ \left( n^{(jk)} - 1 \right)
    \]
    where $I_{jk}$ is the set of $n^{(jk)}$ units with both $Y_j$ and $Y_k$ observed
    
### Problems with pairwise AC estimators on correlation

* Correlation estimator 1:
\[
r_{jk}^* = \frac{s_{jk}^{(jk)}}{\sqrt{s_{jj}^{(j)} s_{kk}^{(k)}}}
\]

    - `r red('Problem: it can lie outside of $(-1, 1)$')`

* Correlation estimator 2 corrects the previous problem:
\[
r_{jk}^{(jk)} = \frac{s_{jk}^{(jk)}}{\sqrt{s_{jj}^{(jk)} s_{kk}^{(jk)}}}
\]

* `r green('Under MCAR, all these estimators on covariance and correlation are consistent')`

* `r red('However, when $K > 3$, both correlation estimators can yield correlation matrices that are not positive definite!')`

    - An extreme example: $r_{12} = 1, r_{13} = 1, r_{23} = -1$
    
### Compare CC and AC methods

* When data is MCAR and correlations are mild, AC methods are more efficient than CC

* When correlations are large, CC methods are usually better
