Finally, a post not about cooking ... 

I recently gave a 1.5-hours lecture to friends who were interested in 
Bayesian statistics, and the slides are [here](https://github.com/yingboli/StatisticsNotes/blob/master/Bayesian_intro_lectures/030318_intro_Bayesian_lecture_for_IT_60min.pdf). 


This lecture covers (very briefly) the following topics

* Bayes formula (i.e., conditional probablity) 

  * Example: breast cancer screening

* Bayesian parameter estimation (i.e., posterior distribution formula)

  * Beta-Binomial updating, with a coin flipping example
  * Example: Bayesian inference on the Rotten Tomato "freshness" of the Harry Potter
movie series (This is what the above picture is about)
  * MCMC (very high-level intro)
  
* Bayesian hypothesis testing
