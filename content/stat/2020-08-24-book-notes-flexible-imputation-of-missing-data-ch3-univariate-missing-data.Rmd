### Notations

* In this chapter, we assume that there is only one variable having missing values.
We call this variable $y$ the target variable. 

    - $y_\text{obs}$: the $n_1$ observed data in $y$
    - $y_\text{mis}$: the $n_0$ missing data in $y$
    - $\dot{y}$: imputed values in $y$

* Suppose $X$ are the variables (covariates) in the imputation model.

    - $X_\text{obs}$: the subset of $n_1$ rows of $X$ which $y$ is observed
    - $X_\text{mis}$: the subset of $n_0$ rows of $X$ which $y$ is missing

# Imputation under the Normal Linear Model

### Four methods to impute under the normal linear model

1. Regression imputation: *Predict* `r red('(bad!)')`. Fit a linear model on the observed data and get the OLS 
estimates $\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1$. Impute with the predicted values 
\[
\dot{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + X_\text{mis} \hat{\beta}_1
\]
    - In `mice` package, this method is `norm.predict`

2. Stochastic regression imputation: *Predict + noise* `r red('(better, but still bad)')`. Also add a random drawn noise
from the estimated residual normal distribution
\[
\dot{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + X_\text{mis} \hat{\beta}_1 + \dot{\epsilon}, \quad
\dot{\epsilon} \sim \text{N}(0, \hat{\sigma}^2)
\]
    - In `mice` package, this method is `norm.nob`

### Method 3: Bayesian multiple imputation

* *Predict + noise + parameter uncertainty* 
\[
\dot{y} = \dot{\beta}_0 + X_\text{mis} \dot{\beta}_1 + \dot{\epsilon}, \quad
\dot{\epsilon} \sim \text{N}(0, \dot{\sigma}^2)
\]

* Under the priors (where the hyper-parameter $\kappa$ is fixed at a small value, e.g., $\kappa = 0.0001$)
\[
\beta \sim \text{N}(0,  \mathbf{I}_p/\kappa), \quad p(\sigma^2) \propto 1/\sigma^2
\]
We draw $\dot{\beta}$ (including both $\dot{\beta}_0$ and $\dot{\beta}_1$), $\dot{\sigma^2}$ from the posterior distribution

* In `mice` package, this method is `norm`

### Method 4: Bootstrap multiple imputation

* *Predict + noise + parameter uncertainty* 
\[
\dot{y} = \dot{\beta}_0 + X_\text{mis} \dot{\beta}_1 + \dot{\epsilon}, \quad
\dot{\epsilon} \sim \text{N}(0, \dot{\sigma}^2)
\]
where $\dot{\beta}_0$, $\dot{\beta}_1$, and $\dot{\sigma^2}$ are OLS estimates
calculated form a bootstrap sample taken from the observed data

* In `mice` package, this method is `norm.boot`

### A simulation study, to impute MCAR missing in $y$ 

* Missing rate $50\%$ in $y$, and number of imputations $m = 5$.
    - From coverage, `norm`, `norm.boot`, and listwise deletion are good
    - From CI width, listwise deletion is better than multiple imputation here, but it's not always this case,
    especially when the number of covariates is large.
    - `r red('RMSE is not imformative at all!')`

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/flexible_imputation_tab3_1.png', error = FALSE)
```
### A simulation study, to impute MCAR missing in $x$ 

* Missing rate $50\%$ in $x$, and number of imputations $m = 5$.
    - `norm.predict` is severely biased; `norm` is slightly biased
    - From coverage, `norm`, `norm.boot`, and listwise deletion are good
    - `r red('Again, RMSE is not imformative at all!')`

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/flexible_imputation_tab3_2.png', error = FALSE)
```


### Impute from a (continuous) non-normal distributions

* Optional 1: mean predictive matching

* Optional 2: model the non-normal data directly
    - E.g., impute from a t-distribution
    - The [GAMLSS](https://www.gamlss.com/) package: extends GLM and GAM
    

# Predictive Mean Matching

### `r blue('Predictive mean matching (PMM)')`, general principle

* For each missing entry, the method forms a small set of candidate donors (3, 5, or 10)
from completed cases whose predicted values closest to the predicted value for the missing entry

* One donor is randomly drawn from the candidates, and the observed value of the donor is taken to replace the missing value

### Advantages of predictive mean matching (PMM)

* `r green('PMM is fairly robust to transformations of the target variable')`

* `r green('PMM can also be used for discrete target variables')`

* `r green('PMM is fairly robust to model misspecification')`
    - In the following example, the relationship between age and BMI is not linear, but PMM seems to preserve this relationship better than linear normal model
    
```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/flexible_imputation_fig3_6.png', error = FALSE)
```
    
### How to select the donors

* Once the metric has been defined, there are four ways to select the donors.
    - Let $\hat{y}_i$ denote the predicted values of rows with observed $y_i$
    - Let $\hat{y}_j$ denote the predicted values of rows with missing $y_j$
    
1. Pre-specify a threshold $\eta$, take all $i$ such that $\left| \hat{y}_i -  \hat{y}_j\right| < \eta$ as donors,
and randomly sample one donor to impute
2. Choose the closest candidate as the donor (only 1 donor), also called (`r blue('nearest neighbor hot deck')`)
3. Pre-specify a number $d$,  take the $d$ closest candidate as donors, and randomly sample one donor to impute. 
Usually, $d = 3, 5, 10$
4. Sample one donor with a probability that depends on the distance $\left| \hat{y}_i -  \hat{y}_j\right|$
    - Implemented by the `midastouch` method in `mice`, and also the `midastouch` package

### Types of matching

* Type 0: $\hat{y} = X_\text{obs} \hat{\beta}$ is matched to $\hat{y}_j = X_\text{mis} \hat{\beta}$
    - `r red('Bad: it ignores the sampling variability in ')`$\hat{\beta}$
* Type 1: $\hat{y} = X_\text{obs} \hat{\beta}$ is matched to $\dot{y}_j = X_\text{mis} \dot{\beta}$
    - Here, $\dot{\beta}$ is a random draw from the posterior distribution
    - `r green('Good')`. The default in `mice`
* Type 2: $\dot{y} = X_\text{obs} \dot{\beta}$ is matched to $\dot{y}_j = X_\text{mis} \dot{\beta}$
    - `r red('Not very ideal, when model is small, the same donors get selected too often')`
* Type 3: $\dot{y} = X_\text{obs} \dot{\beta}$ is matched to $\ddot{y}_j = X_\text{mis} \ddot{\beta}$
    - Here, $\dot{\beta}$ and $\ddot{\beta}$ are two different random draws from the posterior distribution
    - `r green('Good')`
    
### Illustration of Type 1 matching

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/flexible_imputation_fig3_7.png', error = FALSE)
```

### Number of donors $d$

* $d=1$ is too low `r red('(bad!)')`. It may select the same donor over and over again

* The default in `mice` is $d=5$. Also, $d = 3, 10$ are also feasible

### Pitfalls of PMM

* If the data is small, or if there is a region where the missing rate is high, then the same donors may be used for too many times.

* Mis-specification of the impute model

* PMM cannot be used to extrapolate beyond the range of the data, or to interpolate within the region where data is sparse

* PMM may not perform well with small datasets

# Imputation under CART

### Multiple imputation under a tree model

* `missForest`: `r red('single imputation with CART is bad')`

* `r green('Multiple imputation under a tree model using the bootstrap')`:
1. Draw a bootstrap sample among the observed data, and fit a CART model $f(X)$
2. For each missing value $y_j$, find it's terminal node $g_j$. All the $d_j$ cases in this node are the donors
3. Randomly select one donor to impute

    - When fitting the tree, it may be useful to pre-set the size of nodes to be 5 or 10
    - We can also use random forest instead of CART

# Imputing Categorical and Other Types of Data

### Imputation under Bayesian GLMs

* Binary data: logistic regression (`logreg` method in `mice`)
    - In case of data separation, use a more informative Bayesian prior

* Categorical variable with $K$ unordered categories: multinomial logit model 
(`polyreg` method in `mice` package)
\[
P(y_i = k\mid X_i, \beta) = \frac{\exp(X_i \beta_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(X_i \beta_j)}
\]

* Categorical variable with $K$ ordered categories: ordered logit model
(`polr` method in `mice` package)
\[
P(y_i \leq k\mid X_i, \beta, \tau_k) = \frac{\exp(\tau_k - X_i \beta)}{1 + \exp(\tau_k - X_i \beta)}
\]
    - For identifiability, set $\tau_1 = 0$

* `r red('When impute from these GLM models, make sure to not use the MLE of parameters, but either a draw from posterior, or a bootstraped estimate.')`

### Categorical variables are harder to impute than continuous ones

* Empirically, the GLM imputations do not perform well
    - If missing rate exceeds 0.4
    - If the data is imbalanced
    - If there are many categories

* GLM imputation is found inferior than CART or latent class models 
    

### Imputation of count data

* Option 1: predictive mean matching
* Option 2: ordered categorical imputation
* Option 3: (zero-inflated) Poisson regression
* Option 4: (zero-inflated) negative binomial regression

### Imputation of semi-continuous data

* `r blue('Semi-continuous data')`: has a high mass at one point (often zero) and a continuous distribution over the remaining values

* Option 1: model the data in two parts: logistic regression + regression
* Option 2: predictive mean matching
