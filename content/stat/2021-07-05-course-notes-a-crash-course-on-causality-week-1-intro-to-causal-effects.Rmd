# Notations and Terminologies

### Notations

* We are interested in the causal effect of some treatment $A$ on some outcome $Y$

* `r blue('Treatment')`: $A$, binary

    - $A=1$ if receive treatment; and $A=0$ if receive control

    - Example: $A=1$ if receive active drug; and $A=0$ if receive placebo
    

* `r blue('Outcome')`: $Y$, can be binary or continuous

    - Example: $Y=1$ if dead; $Y=0$ otherwise
    - Example: $Y$ can be time until death
    
* Pre-treatment covariates: $X$

## Potential outcomes and conterfactuals

### Potential outcomes

* `r blue('Potential outcome')` $Y^a$ is the outcome we would see if treatment was set to $A=a$

* Each person has potential outcome $Y^0, Y^1$

### Counterfactuals

* `r blue('Conterfactual outcomes')`: the outcomes would have been observed, had the treatment been different

    - If my treatment is $A=1$, then my counterfactual outcomes is $Y^0$

    - If my treatment is $A=0$, then my counterfactual outcomes is $Y^1$
    
* Connection between potential and conterfactuals outcomes

    - **Before** the treatment decision is made, any outcome is a potential outcome, $Y^0$ and $Y^1$
    - **After** the study, there is an observed outcome $Y^A$, and counterfactual outcome $Y^{1-A}$
    
### Immutable variables

* Variables that we cannot control (or change), such as race, gender, age, are `r blue('immutable variables')`

* For immutable variables, causal effects are not well defined
    
* In this course, we focus on treatments that could be thought of as **interventions**

# What are Causal Effects?

### Causal effects

* Definition: treatment $A$ has a `r blue('causal effect')` on the outcome $Y$, if $Y^1$ differs from $Y^0$

* Example
    - $Y$: headache gone one hour from now (yes$=1$, no$=0$)
    - $A$: take ibuprofen ($A=1$) or not ($A=0$)

## Fundamental problem of causal inference

### Fundamental problem of causal inference

* `r blue('Fundamental problem of causal inference')`:
we can only observe one potential outcome for each person

* However, with certain assumptions, we can estimate **population level** (average) causal effects
$E(Y^1 - Y^0)$

    - Average value of $Y$ if everyone was treated with $A=1$ minus average value of $Y$ if everyone was treated with $A=0$

* Headache example:
    - `r red('Hopeless')`: What would have happened to me had I not taken ibuprofen? (Unit level causal effect)
    - `r green('Hopeful')`: What would the rate of headache remission be if everyone took ibuprofen when they had a headache versus if no one did? (Population level causal effect)
    
### Visualization of population average causal effect

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/crash_course_causality_week1_fig1.png', error = FALSE)
```

### Population average causal effect versus conditioning on treatment/control 

\[
E(Y^1 - Y^0) \neq E(Y\mid A=1) - E(Y\mid A=0)
\]

* In the left hand side, 
$E(Y^1)$ is the mean of $Y$ if the whole population was treated with $A=1$


* In the right hand side, 
$E(Y\mid A=1)$ is restricting to the **subpopulation** of people who actually had $A=1$

    - This subpopulation may differ from the whole population in important ways
    - For example, people at higher risk for flu are more likely to choose to get a flu shot
    
* $E(Y\mid A=1) - E(Y\mid A=0)$ is not a causal effect,
because it is comparing two different populations of people

### Visualization of real world

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/figures/crash_course_causality_week1_fig2.png', error = FALSE)
```

### Other causal effects

* $E(Y^1 / Y^0)$: causal relative risk

* $E(Y^1 - Y^0 \mid A=1)$: causal effect of treatment on the treated

* $E(Y^1 - Y^0 \mid V=v)$: average causal effect in the subpopulation with covariate $V=v$

# Causal Assumptions

### Most common causal assumptions

* Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

* Consistency

* Ignorability

* Positivity


## Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

### Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

* SUTVA involves two assumptions

1. No interference

    - Units do not interfere with each other
    - Treatment assignement of one unit does not affect that outcome of another unit
    - Spillover or contagion are also terms for interference

2. One version of treatment

* `r green("SUTVA allows us to write potential outcome for a person in terms of only that person's treatments")`

## Consistency

### Consistency assumption 

* `r blue('Consistency assumption')`: the potential outcome under treatment $A=a$, $Y^a$, is equal to the observed outcome if the actual treatment received is $A=a$

\[
Y=Y^a \text{ if } A=a, \text{ for all } a
\]

## Ignorability

### Ignorability assumption

* `r blue('Ignorability assumption')`: 
given pre-treatment covariates $X$, treatment assignment is independent from the potential outcomes
\[
Y^0, Y^1 \perp A \mid X
\]

* **Among people with the same values of $X$, we can think of treatment $A$ as being randomly assigned**

* Example: $Y^0$ and $Y^1$ are not independent from $A$ marginally, but within levels of $X$, treatment might be randomly assigned

    - $X$: age; can take values 'younger' or 'older'
    - $Y$: hip fracture
    - Older people are more likely to get treatment $A=1$
    - Older people are also more likely to have the outcome, regardless of treatment

## Positivity 

### Positivity assumption

* `r blue('Positivity assumption')`: for every set of values of $X$, treatment assignment was not deterministic
\[
P(A=a \mid X=x) > 0, \text{ for all } a \text{ and } x
\]

* If for some values of $X$, treatment was deterministic, then we would have no observed values of $Y$ for one of the treatment groups for those values of $X$

# Standardization and Stratification

### Observed data and potential outcomes 

* Under all above assumptions, the observed data average outcome $E(Y\mid A=a, X=x)$ equals the potential outcomes $E(Y^a \mid X=x)$

\begin{align*}
E(Y\mid A=a, X=x) 
&= E(Y^a\mid A=a, X=x) \text{ by consistency}\\
&= E(Y^a\mid X=x) \text{ by ignorability}\\
\end{align*}

* If we want a marginal causal effect, we can average over $X$
\[
E(Y^a) = \sum_x E(Y \mid A=a, X=x) P(X=x)
\]

### Standardization

* `r blue('Standardization')` involves `r green('stratifying')` and then `r green('averaging')`

    - First obtain the mean treatment effect within each stratum
    $E(Y \mid A=a, X=x)$
    - Then pool across stratum, weighing by the probability (size) of each stratum $P(X=x)$

### Standardization example: two diabetes treatments

* Treatments: saxagliptin (new medicine) vs sitagliptin

* Outcome: major adverse cardiac event (MACE)

* Covariate: past use of oral antidiabetic (OAD) drug

* `r red('Challenge')`

    - Saxa users were more likely to have past use of OAD drug
    - Patients with past use of OAD drugs are at higher risk of MACE
    
* `r green('Stratify')` parents in two subpopulations by whether having prior OAD use

    - Within levels of the prior OAD use variable, treatment can be thought of as randomized (ignorability)

### Example continued: unstratified 

: Unstratified raw data

|          | MACE=yes | MACE=no | Total |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
|Saxa=yes  | 350      | 3650    | 4000  |
|Saxa=no   | 500      | 6500    | 7000  |
|Total     | 850      | 10150   | 11000 |

\begin{align*}
&P(\text{MACE} \mid \text{Saxa}=\text{yes}) 
= 350/4000 = 0.088\\
&P(\text{MACE} \mid \text{Saxa}=\text{no}) 
= 500/7000 = 0.071
\end{align*}

### Example continued: subpopulation without prior OAD use

: Prior OAD use = no

|          | MACE=yes | MACE=no | Total |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
|Saxa=yes  | 50       | 950     | 1000  |
|Saxa=no   | 200      | 3800    | 4000  |
|Total     | 250      | 4750    | 5000  |

\begin{align*}
&P(\text{MACE} \mid \text{Saxa}=\text{yes}) 
= 50/1000 = 0.05\\
&P(\text{MACE} \mid \text{Saxa}=\text{no}) 
= 200/4000 = 0.05
\end{align*}

### Example continued: subpopulation with prior OAD use

: Prior OAD use = yes

|          | MACE=yes | MACE=no | Total |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
|Saxa=yes  | 300      | 2700    | 3000  |
|Saxa=no   | 300      | 2700    | 3000  |
|Total     | 600      | 5400    | 6000  |

\begin{align*}
&P(\text{MACE} \mid \text{Saxa}=\text{yes}) 
= 300/3000 = 0.10\\
&P(\text{MACE} \mid \text{Saxa}=\text{no}) 
= 300/3000 = 0.10
\end{align*}
 
### Example continued: mean potential outcome for Saxa

\begin{align*}
& E(Y^{\text{saxa}})\\
= ~& E(Y\mid A=\text{saxa}, X = \text{prior OAD use yes})
  P(\text{prior OAD use yes})\\
  & + 
  E(Y\mid A=\text{saxa}, X = \text{prior OAD use no})
  P(\text{prior OAD use no})\\
= & (300/3000) (6000/11000) + (50/1000) (5000/11000) \\
= & 0.077
\end{align*}

* Similarly, $E(Y^{\text{sita}}) = 0.077$

* Hence, the treatment Saxa or not has no causal effects on the MACE outcome

### `r red('Problems with standardization')`

* There will be many $X$ variables needed to achieve ignorability

* Stratification would lead to many `r red('empy cells')`

* `r green('Alternative to standardization')`: matching inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), etc
